# Does Number Exist?

A Buzzfeed-style quiz to discover your philosophy of mathematics.

## About

Where is the number 7? Is it real? Was it discovered or invented? If all minds vanished, would mathematical truths still hold?

These are genuine open questions in philosophy. Mathematics works — we just don't know *what it is*.

Philosophers disagree. Mathematicians disagree. This quiz won't settle it — but it might help you find your position.

## The Five Positions

| | Position | Tagline |
|---|---|---|
| 🏛️ | **Platonism** | "Numbers are real. We discover them." |
| 🎭 | **Fictionalism** | "Numbers don't exist. Math is useful fiction." |
| 🎮 | **Formalism** | "Math is symbol manipulation. The game is the thing." |
| 🔨 | **Intuitionism** | "Math is mental construction. We build it." |
| 🕸️ | **Structuralism** | "Numbers are positions in patterns, not objects." |

## Features

- **10 questions** probing the philosophical axes that actually differentiate positions
- **Simple Words mode** — toggle to rephrase everything using common vocabulary
- **Score distribution** showing your tendencies across all five positions
- **Runner-up** position for the philosophically pluralistic
- **No wrong answers** — philosophers have been arguing for millennia

## Why This Matters

We don't know if 7 exists. This isn't a gap in scientific knowledge waiting to be filled — it's a genuinely open philosophical question with serious thinkers on all sides.

Your answer reflects deep intuitions about:
- What makes something "real"
- How knowledge works
- The relationship between mind and world
- Whether mathematics is discovered or invented

## The Positions Explained

**Platonism**: Numbers exist independently of us, like mountains we discover rather than build. The challenge: how do physical brains access non-physical abstract objects?

**Fictionalism**: Math is useful fiction, like Sherlock Holmes. Literally false, but enormously helpful. The challenge: why is this particular fiction so unreasonably effective?

**Formalism**: Math is a game with symbols and rules. Don't ask what numbers "really are" — just play the game. The challenge: Gödel showed formal systems can't capture all mathematical truth.

**Intuitionism**: Math exists only when we construct it through mental acts. No completed infinities, no proofs by contradiction. The challenge: rejects much of classical mathematics.

**Structuralism**: Numbers aren't objects — they're positions in patterns. "2" is whatever occupies the 2-position in a number-like structure. The challenge: aren't structures themselves abstract objects?

## Simple Words Mode

Mathematical philosophy is accessible — it's just locked behind jargon. The "Simple Words" toggle rephrases everything without dumbing it down:

- "Abstract realm" → "not in any place but still real"
- "Mind-independent" → "true whether or not anyone is there to know it"
- "Ontological commitment" → "saying something is real"

Same depth, no gatekeeping.

*"The ontology of mathematics is genuinely unresolved. Philosophers have debated this for over two thousand years. Your position reflects deep intuitions about knowledge, existence, and abstraction. That's not a bug — it's one of the oldest and deepest questions in human thought."*
